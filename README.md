# Unity Shader Test

### Repository for Unity shader example

These are examples of various Unity shaders, coming from different sources (ShaderToy, Unity websites, tutorial, youtube videos and so on). It's basically learning material to explore how shaders work, not to use in production. They are developed and tested only with Unity Standard Rendering Pipeline.

Personally I would like to give a big thanks to all the people that make available all the material that anyone can use to learn something new every day. Frankly, I don't know how I could learn all this stuff without these examples.

Shaderes are collected inside the path Flecheria/.../... etc.

Open to questions, knowledge and contributions.

### Notes

Remember for reflection inside DevelopmentBasic scene to setup the default CubeMap for Environment Reflections:
